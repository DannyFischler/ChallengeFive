## Daily Planner

The Daily Planner is a web-based application designed to help users schedule their day efficiently. The planner provides an hour-by-hour breakdown of the standard business hours, from 9am to 5pm, and allows users to save events or tasks for each time block. Furthermore, the planner is equipped with a visually intuitive interface that color-codes time blocks based on their status: past, present, or future.

### Features:

- **Current Day Display**: The current day is prominently displayed at the top of the planner.
- **Hourly Time Blocks**: Time blocks are available for each hour of the standard business day.
- **Dynamic Color Coding**: Time blocks are color-coded to easily identify past, present, and future time slots.
- **Event Saving**: Click on a time block to enter an event. Once entered, click the 'Save' button to store the event. All saved events persist on page refresh.
- **Dark Mode**: The planner offers a dark mode to reduce eye strain and provide a different aesthetic. Simply click on the "Dark Mode" switch at the top of the planner to toggle between light and dark modes.

### Usage:

1. **Open the Planner**: Launch the web application. The current day will be displayed at the top.
2. **Enter an Event**: Click into any time block and type your event or task.
3. **Save the Event**: Click the 'Save' button next to the time block where you've entered your event. Your event will be stored in local storage and will persist even if you close or refresh the page.
4. **Toggle Dark Mode**: Click on the "Dark Mode" switch located at the top of the planner.
